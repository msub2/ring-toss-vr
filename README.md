# Ring Toss VR

A super basic ring toss game using A-Frame, Rapier physics, and WebXR made in about 7 hours total development time. Pick up the ring with trigger and try to toss it onto one of the pegs! Was going to add a time limit but then realized I had 5 minutes left to submit so I guess maybe next time!
